    <p class="about-modal__text">
      The ice cream cone would seem to be a simple and unpolitical a treat, yet
      it's origin is hotly contested. The most favored folk tale regarding the
      invention of the ice cream cone takes place at the 1904 World's Fair held
      in St. Louis, Missouri. Two food vendors had stalls next to each other.
      Arnold Fornachou made and sold ice cream. His neighbor, Ernest A. Hamwi,
      had come to the United States from Damascus, Syria.
